# Story Generator

## Project Description

Story Generator is a web app where people can use AI to create stories. It offers secure sign-up and login, with different views for users and admins. Users can read custom stories generated by AI. Meanwhile, admins have extra tools to manage users and keep everything running smoothly.

## Why I Made This Project

I worked on this project with my school group to get hands-on experience building a full-stack app with secure user authentication. We also wanted to explore using AI, so we integrated OpenAI into the project to add some smart features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v6.0.0 or higher)
- MySQL (v8.0 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MartinS3030/Story_Generator
```

2. Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd Story_Generator
```

3. Install backend dependencies
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

4. Install frontend dependencies
```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

5. Set up the MySQL database
- Create a new MySQL database
- Configure your database connection in the server's config file

6. Start the development servers
```bash
# Start the backend server
cd server
npm start

# In a new terminal, start the frontend
cd client
npm start
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000
